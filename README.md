##### Level of Achievement:
Project Gemini

##### Target Audience:
Students, Teachers, and Self-learners of any age

##### Problem motivation:
Learners meet with queries and problems regarding study. Sometimes they lack learning materials and exercises. Sometimes their questions are too specific to search online. Sometimes explanations of a concept in class are not clear and one may be shy to reach out for help. Can’t find the exact question?  Can’t find a clear answer? Asking people is inefficient? Don’t panic! Answer Master is here to end your confusion! A platform with enabled mutual Q&A process, follow-up discussion, even customized quizzes that would be created by you! Unlike competitor’s platform which lists all questions according to time, we sort questions of a certain category by users’ evaluation. In addition to helping learners who need help, competent learners can be willing to help their peers with queries, meanwhile, gain recognition and credit by a well-organised platform.

##### Functionalities:
1. Academic Q&A forum that can be either private or public.
2. Easy evaluation of the credibility of answers by the credit of the answerer and the rate of the answer.
3. Easy search for questions of a particular field and level.
